Releaes Notes:
#16057: Build Tool automatic generation of makefiles.
The makefiles and makefilemodules would be automatically generated. With this, the developer is decoupled from the build process, makefiles etc..The developer can simply add a C file and run Build without bothering about the makefiles.
A file ignoreMakefileList.txt in BUILD/SYS directory  prevents the generation of makefiles of the modules mentioned in the ignoreMakefileList.txt,.
